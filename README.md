# Loan-Prediction
Finding the best Machine learning Models for the Loan Eligibility Prediction


we are going to work on binary classification problem, where we got some information about sample of peoples , and we need to predict whether we should give some one a loan or not depending on his information . we actually have a few sample size (614 rows), so we will go with machine learning techniques to solve our problem .

Steps : basics of visualizing the data . how to compare between feature importance (at less in this data) .

feature selection

feature engineer

some simple techniques to process the data . handling missing data . how to deal with categorical and numerical data . outliers data detection but the most important thing that you will learn , is how to evaluate your model at every step you take .

some important libraries like sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy fill the values using backward 'bfill' method for numerical columns , and most frequent value for categorical columns (simple techniques) 4 different models to train your data, so we can compare between them

a) logistic regression

b) KNeighborsClassifier

C) SVC

d) DecisionTreeClassifier
